  Vijay is a popular name, especially in India, and it could refer to several
  individuals, but I'll assume you're asking about a well-known figure. Vijay,
  often used as a first name, is also the stage name of Joseph Vijay
  Chandrasekhar, a prominent actor in the Tamil film industry, commonly referred
  to as Kollywood. Born on June 22, 1974, Vijay has established himself as one
  of the leading actors in South Indian cinema. He made his acting debut as a
  child artist in the film "Vetri" (1984) and later transitioned into lead roles
  with "Naalaiya Theerpu" (1992). Since then, he has starred in numerous
  successful films spanning various genres, including action, romance, and
  drama. Some of his most notable movies include "Ghilli," "Thuppakki,"
  "Kaththi," and "Mersal."
